## Non-profit/for-profit company registry requirements ##
 
 
### Non-profit registry requirements ###
 
The most common legal forms for NPOS used in Austria are “registered associations” , foundations, “corporations” and “co-operatives”.
 
Corporations can be awarded the status of a non-profit corporation (by fiscal authorities), if their statutes codify the non-profitability and if this can be verified in practice. Because the commercial register does not indicate if a corporation is listed as a non-profit corporation, it is impossible to determine their number on the basis of the register.
 
The Austrian legislation defines two types of foundations in Austria: the federal foundation (or regular foundations) and the private foundation. The laws which govern these entities are the Private Foundation Act-Privatstiftungsgesetz (PSG) 1993 and the law for federal foundations and funds of 1974. Both types of foundations that can be opened in Austria are characterized by the lack of profit shared among the members and no membership.  According to the “Law on federal foundations and funds” a regular foundation is established as a result of a notarized deed or testament with funds dedicated to a defined goal with charitable character or for the public interest, accepted by the Office of the President of the State or by a federal ministry (only in certain cases).
 
The regular foundations created in Austria must be registered in a register supervised by the Minister of Interior. Financial reports must be deposited at the Foundation Authority (Stiftungsbehörde) which is the foundations’ supervising agency. The Foundation Authority has the power to dismiss the members of the foundation’s board if certain regulations are not followed. In case of dismissal, the Authority is appointing a foundation governor that has the role of appointing a new management board for the NGO created in Austria.
 
A major advantage of holding a regular foundation with public interest in Austria is that it is exempt from corporate income tax and has to pay only a withholding tax on specific types of investment income only, with the rate of 25%. Unlike the majority of the foundations established in many European countries, the majorities of Austrian foundations are private and may pursue a private goal, without contributing to the welfare production.
 
A private foundation is a legal person with organization and aims established in its declaration of establishment by its donor. This type of legal entity must have its residence in Austria and must be registered in the Commercial Register. A private foundation is incorporated through a declaration of establishment, which consists in a foundation deed and an appendix. These documents must contain the name of the foundation, the assets, the objectives, the location, the structure of the foundation’s boards and the modality of appointing the members, the beneficiaries (last ones are usually included in the appendix).
 
A foundation is usually formed by the following bodies: the board of directors, the supervisory board and the auditors.
